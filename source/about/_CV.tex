  \ecvsection{Work experience}
  \ecvitem{February 2014 - ...}{Audiencerate - Software developer/devops}
  \ecvitem{}{I managed the provisioning of the system, which has a load of about 100 req/s. Wrote some simple integration/acceptance tests, Added monitoring into the system, rewrote the code dealing with the database and tested all the software before each production deployment. (Technologies used: Ansible, Vagrant, Selenium, Clojure, Python)}
  \ecvsection{Education and training}
  \ecvitem{}{Bachelor Degree in Computer Engineering}
  \ecvitem{Subjects covered}{Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Economics, Thermodynamics, Electronics, C++ and Java programming courses, Databases, Computer networks, Internet protocols, Operating systems, Industrial automation, Theoretical computer science, Network security, Languages and compilers, Information theory, Project Management, Transmission theory, Telecommunication networks, Computer graphic, Artificial Intelligence, Information Retrieval, Stochastic Models, Model identification and data analysis.\\
& Thesis Work: Adaptation of a georeferentiation search application for a client-server architecture}
  \ecvitem[15pt]{Name of organisation providing education and training}{Universit√† degli Studi di Bergamo}

  \ecvitem{}{Erasmus study period in Computer Science at University of Southern Denmark\\

  \ecvsection{Personal skills and competences}
  \ecvitem{Programming Languages}{
\begin{itemize*}
\item Python: quite proficient, I used it for scripting, heavy computation, web development, dealing with binary formats, wrapping native libraries with ctypes, sketching out some proof of concept gui, I also looked at the internal details of some Python implementations and realized a rewrite of virtualenvwrapper: a tool for managing developer environments
\item Clojure: I use it since slightly less than 2 years, I'm comfortable with the language and the surrounding tooling.
\item Java: Between university projects and the last job I've had the opportunity to deal with legacy Java codebases (no tests, huge amounts of code duplication and accidental complexity), so I won't shy away from them.
\item C: I can read and work on most projects that make use of it but I never directly used it for huge projects
\item Ruby: When I stumbled upon some missing features, I tried to contribute them upstream (e.g.\url{http://git.io/W7e-9w} \url{http://git.io/dgUxlg} )
\item Vala, Haskell, F\#, Javascript, Scala: All of these last languages have been used for
personal interest and for solving university assignments with a different language than usual, I can
make use of external libraries and can understand most of the semantic of those languages, I'm able
to test snippets in their respective repl), I'm also willing to learn quickly any new language that it might arise the need for.
\end{itemize*}
