  \cventry{November 2014 - July 2015}{Security Consultant}{NCCGroup}{}{}{}
  Working at NCCGroup bolstered my knowledge of network protocols, web apps security, Linux systems and Windows domains security thanks to the extensive internal training. After the training I developed some tools for internal use and I was tasked with performing security assessments for multinational companies. Such assessments covered a range of technologies (.NET, Python, PHP, etc.) and had elements of both white box code reviews and black box tests. XSS, CSRF, clear-text storage of passwords, path traversal and remote code execution are among the kind of vulnerability that I found and documented.

  \cventry{September 2014 - October 2014}{Software developer}{CommentBubble}{}{}{}
  Setup the project into a proper Python module, as a building block for testing and continuous integration. Discovered an Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerability and wrote tests to prevent its regression.

  \cventry{February 2014 - October 2014}{Software developer/devops}{Audiencerate}{}{}{}
  Managed the provisioning of the system, which has a load of about 100 req/s. Wrote some simple integration/acceptance tests, added monitoring into the system, rewrote the code dealing with the database and tested all the software before each production deployment. (Technologies used: Ansible, Vagrant, Selenium, Clojure, Python.)

  \section{Personal skills and competences}
  \subsection{Programming Languages}

\cvlistitem{Python: Advanced knowledge. Used for web development, dealing with binary formats, scripting as well as cpu-intensive loads, wrapping native libraries with ctypes, sketching out some proof of concept gui. I also read the internal details of some Python implementations and wrote my own \href{https://github.com/berdario/pew}{simple tool to manage virtual environments}.}
\cvlistitem{Clojure: Used on and off since 2013, I'm comfortable with the language and the surrounding tooling.}
\cvlistitem{Haskell: Good knowledge.}
\cvlistitem{Java: Good knowledge and experience with legacy Java codebases.}
\cvlistitem{Ruby: Contributed some simple patches upstream (e.g. \url{http://git.io/W7e-9w} \url{http://git.io/7kM4Gw}).}
\cvlistitem{Working knowledge of F\#, Ocaml, Javascript, Scala, C, Vala, C\#, SQL.}
