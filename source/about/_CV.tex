  \ecvitem{}{References available upon request.\\}

  \ecvitem{November 2014 - ...}{NCCGroup - Security Consultant}
  \ecvitem{}{Working at NCCGroup bolstered my knowledge of network protocols, web apps security, linux systems and windows domains security thanks to the extensive internal training. After the training I developed some tools for internal use and I was tasked with performing security assessments for multinational companies. Such assessments covered a range of technologies (.NET, Python, PHP, etc.) and had elements of both white box code reviews and black box tests. XSS, CSRF, cleartext storage of passwords, path traversal and remote code execution are among the kind of vulnerability that I found and documented.\\}

  \ecvitem{September 2014 - October 2014}{CommentBubble - Software developer}
  \ecvitem{}{Setup the project into a proper Python module, as a building block for testing and continuous integration. Discovered an Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerability and wrote tests to prevent its regression.\\}

  \ecvitem{February 2014 - October 2014}{Audiencerate - Software developer/devops}
  \ecvitem{}{I managed the provisioning of the system, which has a load of about 100 req/s. Wrote some simple integration/acceptance tests, Added monitoring into the system, rewrote the code dealing with the database and tested all the software before each production deployment. (Technologies used: Ansible, Vagrant, Selenium, Clojure, Python)\\}

  \ecvsection{Personal skills and competences}
  \ecvitem{Programming Languages}{
\begin{itemize*}
\item Python: quite proficient, I used it for scripting, heavy computation, web development, dealing with binary formats, wrapping native libraries with ctypes, sketching out some proof of concept gui, I also looked at the internal details of some Python implementations and realized a rewrite of virtualenvwrapper: a tool for managing developer environments
\item Clojure: I use it since slightly less than 2 years, I'm comfortable with the language and the surrounding tooling.
\item Java: Between university projects and the last job I've had the opportunity to deal with legacy Java codebases (no tests, huge amounts of code duplication and accidental complexity), so I won't shy away from them.
\item C: I can read and work on most projects that make use of it but I never directly used it for huge projects
\item Ruby: When I stumbled upon some missing features, I tried to contribute them upstream (e.g.\url{http://git.io/W7e-9w} \url{http://git.io/7kM4Gw} )
\item Vala, Haskell, F\#, Javascript, Scala: All of these last languages have been used for
personal interest and for solving university assignments with a different language than usual, I can
make use of external libraries and can understand most of the semantic of those languages, I'm able
to test snippets in their respective repl), I'm also willing to learn quickly any new language that it might arise the need for.
