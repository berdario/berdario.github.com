  \ecvsection{Personal skills and competences}
  \ecvitem{Programming Languages}{
Python: quite proficient, I used it for scripting, heavy computation, web development, dealing with binary formats, wrapping native libraries with ctypes, sketching out some proof of concept gui, I also looked at the internal details of some Python implementations and realized a rewrite of virtualenvwrapper: a tool for managing developer environments\\
& Java: Used for most of the university assignments, mainly involving inxeding of documents or other server side tasks\\
& C: I can read and work on most projects that make use of it but I never directly used it for huge projects\\
& Clojure: I picked it up recently, and used it to solve small problems with logic programming (\url{https://code.launchpad.net/~berdario/regexp-unfolder/trunk} ) \\
& Ruby: When I stumbled upon some missing features, I tried to contribute them upstream (e.g.\url{http://git.io/W7e-9w} \url{http://git.io/dgUxlg} ) \\
& Vala, Haskell, F\#, Javascript, Scala: All of these last languages have been used for
personal interest and for solving university assignments with a different language than usual, I can
make use of external libraries and can understand most of the semantic of those languages, I'm able
to test snippets in their respective repl), I'm also willing to learn quickly any new language that it might
arise the need for.
